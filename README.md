# Introduction
It is so embrassing that the text search feature in Microsoft OneNote is crappy! OneNote just do a text matching over all the pages and return the exact result to handle the query. That's why I want to use Lucene.NET to enhance it.  

# Prerequisite
Lucene.Net 3.0.3
Visual Studio 2017
